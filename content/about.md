I am Anupam Singh, deeply interested in coding and hacking, with a primary focus on cybersecurity. My journey in these fields began during the lockdown period. I am particularly fascinated by application security, and I am always seeking to deepen my expertise through continuous research. In addition to my technical pursuits, I am an avid fan of anime, 
with a preference for action and psychological thrillers. I also enjoy exploring various aspects of history and space exploration, particularly the achievements of ancient civilizations and the future possibilities of space travel. Gaming is another passion, where I prefer strategy and role-playing games.
